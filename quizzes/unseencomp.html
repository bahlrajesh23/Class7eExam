      <h2>Passage 1: The Coral Reef Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, often called the "rainforests of the sea." They occupy less than 1% of the ocean floor but are home to about 25% of all marine species. Reefs are formed by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons. These structures provide shelter and food for countless organisms. The relationship between coral and zooxanthellae algae is particularly important - the algae live within the coral's tissues and provide nutrients through photosynthesis, while the coral provides protection and access to light. Coral reefs face numerous threats today, including ocean acidification, rising sea temperatures, and destructive fishing practices. When corals become stressed, they expel their algae in a process called bleaching, which can lead to the death of the reef if conditions don't improve. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these vital ecosystems that support fisheries, protect coastlines from storms, and contribute to medical discoveries.</p>

      <h2>Passage 2: The Industrial Revolution</h2>
      <p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a major turning point in history. It represented the shift from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing processes, iron production, and the increasing use of steam power. The development of the steam engine by James Watt was particularly significant, revolutionizing transportation and manufacturing. Factories emerged, drawing people from rural areas to cities in search of work, leading to urbanization. While industrialization brought economic growth and technological advancement, it also created poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution. The revolution spread to Europe and North America, fundamentally changing society. It led to the growth of the middle class and changed family structures as work moved outside the home. The textile industry was among the first to be transformed, with inventions like the spinning jenny and power loom dramatically increasing production. The Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for our modern industrialized world.</p>

      <h2>Passage 3: The Water Cycle</h2>
      <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process by which water moves through the environment. It begins with evaporation, where water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to the sun's heat. This vapor rises and cools, forming clouds through condensation. When the clouds become heavy, precipitation occurs in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This water then returns to the surface and collects in bodies of water or soaks into the ground, a process called infiltration. Some of the water that infiltrates becomes groundwater and may re-emerge later through springs. The cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature, supporting plant and animal life, and distributing fresh water across the planet. Human activities such as deforestation and pollution can disrupt the water cycle and lead to environmental challenges like droughts and floods.</p>

      <h2>Passage 4: Life of Honeybees</h2>
      <p>Honeybees are essential pollinators that play a critical role in the ecosystem and agriculture. A hive consists of three main types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. The queen bee's job is to lay eggs, while the worker bees gather nectar, build the hive, and care for the young. Drones are male bees whose primary purpose is to mate with the queen. Worker bees use their long tongues to extract nectar from flowers, which they then convert into honey and store in wax honeycombs. Bees also collect pollen, which they use as a protein source. In the process of visiting flowers, bees transfer pollen from one flower to another, enabling fertilization and the production of fruits and seeds. Honeybee populations have been declining due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and diseases like Colony Collapse Disorder. Protecting honeybees is vital for food security and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

      <h2>Passage 5: The Solar System</h2>
      <p>The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies, including the Sun, eight planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, all bound together by gravity. The Sun is the center of the solar system and provides the energy needed to support life on Earth. The eight planets orbit the Sun at varying distances, with Mercury being the closest and Neptune the farthest. Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only one known to support life. Each planet has unique features — for example, Jupiter is the largest, and Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its iron-rich soil. The solar system also contains dwarf planets like Pluto and a region of icy bodies called the Kuiper Belt. Exploration of the solar system through telescopes and space missions has expanded our understanding of space and continues to raise new questions about the universe.</p>
